flAmazon Program
===================
This program allows a user to keep track of his/her order on a fictional website called "flAmazon." The user's data is stored in an Access 2013 database. The database is stored in the top-level folder of my Eclipse project, and also in this repository. The shopping cart is shown within a JTable. The program includes a main menu bar with File, Tools, and Help items.
